  content: "You have two options for adding a new device into LibreNMS.<br />

           1. Using the command line via ssh you can add a new device by changing to the directory of your LibreNMS install and typing (be sure to put the correct details).<br /><br />
              <code>./addhost.php <hostname> [community] [v1|v2c] [port] [udp|udp6|tcp|tcp6]</code><br /><br />

           2. Using the web interface, go to Devices and then Add Device. Enter the details required for the device that you want to add and then click 'Add Host'."
