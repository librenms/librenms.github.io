                    <p>The standard way of installing LibreNMS is to clone the GitHub repo directly, to do this you can following the install instructions:</p>
                    <p><a href="http://docs.librenms.org/Installation/Installing-LibreNMS/">Install guides</a><br /></p>
                    <p>If however, you don't have a spare VM or box to install onto then we have got some virtual images for you to download, boot and use straight away. The images will be update regularly (approximately every 3 months), however LibreNMS itself will auto update within 24 hours of you booting the image unless you disable this feature.<br /></p>
