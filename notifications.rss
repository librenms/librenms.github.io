  <title>NUT Ups Application monitoring update</title>
  <description>On December 20th we will be merging a PR that fixes the polling of data for NUT Ups devices.\n\nUnfortunately this will require users to delete the existing data and allow it to be re-created.\n\nTo do this, you can delete rrd files app-ups-nut-ID.rrd. ID will be a unique ID. After removing this file then data collection will start again.</description>
